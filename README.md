This project was built with your existing stack in mind (Next.js, emotion, jest and storybook)

Main folders are:
- components, where every component has 4 types of files for easier navigating:
  - the `component` with the react logic
  - the `styled` file with emotion styles
  - the `stories` file with storybook stories
  - the `tests` file with unit tests

- layouts, where every page layout logic is kept
  - each layout is kept in its folder with both the `component` and `styled` files

- pages

- static
